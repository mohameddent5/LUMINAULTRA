Project Title: Lumina Live - AR Dental Smile Design & Mockup App

Goal: Create a high-performance web application for dentists that uses Real-Time Augmented Reality (AR) to visualize smile designs and veneer mockups on a live webcam feed.

Technical Stack:

Backend: Python (Flask) - Used for serving the application and authentication.

Frontend AI (CRITICAL): MediaPipe Face Mesh (JavaScript/Web Solution).

Constraint: The tracking must run client-side to ensure smooth, 30FPS real-time performance without server lag.

Frontend Graphics: HTML5 Canvas or Three.js for rendering the lines and veneers over the video feed.

Deployment: PythonAnywhere.

Core Features Required:

Live AR Tracking:

The app must open the webcam immediately.

All dental reference lines must stick to the patient's face in real-time as they move, speak, or smile.

Clinical Reference Overlays (Toggleable): Draw the following lines dynamically on the live feed:

Real Midline: Tracks the actual dental midline.

Ideal Midline: Fixed vertical axis based on the pupils/glabella.

Ideal Canine Guide: Connects ideal canine tips.

Smile Curve: Tracks the curvature of the lower lip.

Gingival Curve: Outlines the gum line.

Tooth Proportions: A Golden Proportion grid overlay for the anterior 6 teeth.

"Veneer Mockup" Button (The "Bonus" Feature):

Add a prominent button labeled "Simulate Veneers."

When clicked, overlay a white, ideal tooth texture/mask over the user's existing teeth (using the Face Mesh lips and teeth landmarks to mask the area).

This mockup must track perfectly with the mouth opening and closing.

Clinical Readiness:

The UI must be clean and professional (dark mode preferred).

Include a "Capture" button to save a snapshot of the current analysis to the device.

Output Request:

Provide the main.py (Flask server code).

Provide the templates/index.html containing the JavaScript logic to load MediaPipe FaceMesh from a CDN and handle the AR drawing on the HTML5 Canvas.

Ensure the code handles the camera permissions correctly.

Why this specific prompt?
"Client-side/JavaScript": This ensures the lines don't "lag" behind the patient's face. If you run this on the Python server, there would be a 1-second delay, which is useless for a "mirror" effect.

"Masking/Texture": This tells the AI how to technically achieve the "Veneer" look—by creating a graphical mask over the specific teeth landmarks.
